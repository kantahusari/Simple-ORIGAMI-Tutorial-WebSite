                            <p>Origami or paper folding (as some would call it), is an old Japanese art, yes it is an art not just a children’s game. The beginning of origami was on its departure of Japan and introduction to the world by Alfred Bestall (14 December 1892 – 15 January 1986), one of the fans and lovers of Origami. The origami was first introduced to England after World War II, and then to the world. It has given novelists and lovers of magic tricks the opportunity to use origami to make presentations. Origami is an exquisite art and fun experience, an opportunity to give freedom and space to imagination and to increase the ability to highlight beauty through a small piece of paper. The Origami is a way to exchange and share ideas. As its fans say the origami happiness does not end. Origami is a derivative of two Japanese words: “Ori” which means to fold, and “Gami” or “Kami” that means paper. Origami is known as the art of forming birds and paper shapes. This brief definition and our childhood memories are enough excuses for us to think that Origami is just limited to make some shapes of birds and frogs, so that some would be surprised when he or she hear that is an universal art. It is an art that some will be surprised out of the fact that  some seniors and famous artists spends their time making paper airplanes which we teach children to make out of fun.</p>

                            <h1 id="p2">The history and origin of Origami</h1>
                            <p>Origami first began in China, but with time it moved to Japan and from there to the world, so it was known a Japanese art. The Japanese used Origami for some beliefs in their culture rather than an art. They used models of birds and other animals or any other model to recall its spirit. By the time, and succession of generations Origami became part of the Japanese culture as a way to exchange gifts among samurai and nobles, in the weddings and public festivals, as well as a way to distinguish various ranks of samurai warriors. Another distinctive way to use Origami is as secret messages, where the message was written and folded to shape a model, and once it is open it will be very difficult to be refolded as it was without making new folds, this is how warriors used to know whether the message is still secret or its been read by a stranger.</p>

                            <p>The day the nuclear bombs fell in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, followed by the loss of tens of thousand of souls. There was a two years old girl called “Sadako Sasaki” who was affected by the nuclear radiation and had a leukemia. After she was admitted to the hospital, a friend of her gave her a model of Origami shaped of the form of sacred bird which was a Japanese cultural symbol known to live thousands of years and that sacred bird achieves the wishes of someone who make a thousand stereotypes of Origami.</p>

                            <h1 id="p4">Inspiration</h1>
                            <p>That gift was an inspiration to “Sadako”, she started making a thousand stereotypes of the sacred bird wishing to recover from her illness. Through time she got very weak, her effort to recover became a symbol of world peace. By the time “Sadako” died under the impact of her illness, she had made 644 Origami birds, and her friends make sure to finish the rest. “Sadako” friends started collecting donation to make a memorial for her and world peace, three years later, the statue went out into the light. The celebration of Peace Day is still being held in Japan, where everyone makes models of the bird and places them at the memorial.</p>

                            <h1 id="p5">Misconception</h1>
                            <p>As mentioned before, it is our right to be surprised as long as we are not aware of that art and its capabilities, and what one can create out of its fundamentals. The art of Origami has been developed among the past forty to fifty years, and practically it is now possible to form and create any shape or model of Origami. One of the misconceptions of Origami, is that you use only a square paper or specific dimensions, but you can actually use sheets of all shapes, dimensions and angles and you may use circular papers for some designs and shapes!</p>

                            <h1 id="p6">Origami is not just papers</h1>
                            <p>The Origami is not limited to paper as a raw material, but it is the art of everything that can be folded and shaped. Some artists use foil paper or any rolled thin metal sheets. You can also use forms that you have previously built and prepared as units for building a larger object. The Dutch also used decorative tea bags as raw materials for their designs. While the idea of using cloth napkins to form shapes has spread all over the world. Anyone who is passionate about art and a lover of Origami can do whatever he or she wants from anything as long as it can be bent.</p>

                            <h1 id="p7">Rules of Origami</h1>
                            <p>Unlike other arts that allows flexible rules, Origami is somehow very strict. The rules set by the first makers will make you underestimate your designs if those rules were not followed. Such as using shear to facilitate your work or appearances of cracks and ruptures here and there are all unacceptable. The only acceptable result is that which uses paper folding only without any other help. That shows the complexity and difficulty of that art that requires a wide imagination within limitation to folding only.</p>

                            <h1 id="p8">Paper Types</h1>
                            <p>Whether it is the paper you are using or any other material, as you proceed with the design, you will start to discover the different types of paper and materials. The differences in thickness, size, folding ability and the number of times it can be folded without spoiling and being resilient and formation. All these factors should be considered before start making your design. There are no specific rules, but it is your experience and practice overtime that ensures choosing the right material for your design. Over time you will become a paper expert and you will become able to know what you can make of any material by just holding it from the first time, and you will become one of paper collectors of all shapes and colors and your collection will be the resources for your designs.</p>

                            <p>The rise of Origami as an art that has competitions started in nineties. The intense competition among the designers and their desire to reach the highest level of creativity has led to more complex designs. The competencies increased to a level that some designs consisted of thousands of units of papers. The Origami art is built on geometry with its straight lines and sharp folds. That was only useful when forming models, but when it comes to form creatures, the need for curves arose as a standard to make using straight sharp lines is exceptional! To keep the design intact and strong without spoiling, Origami designers needed sharp and strong angles. That’s why artists faced a difficulties in models that required simple fold or even half folds and models were subject to rapid failure due to of the return of paper to its first condition and instability.</p>

                            <h1 id="p10">Wet paper</h1>
                            <p>Then some artists have come up with the idea of making wet paper forms that have adhesive properties when exposed to water. Designs are formed wet and left to dry to remain unchanged. However, some designers still avoid using this method for the difficulty of dealing with wet paper and forming it according to their needs, because it was separated quickly, as the chance for the paper to be rupture increases as the design becomes complex and require more folds and more units mounted on each other. The Art of Origami is one of the most enjoyable arts for adults and children together, which requires only paper and imagination, it is fun to learn or teach Origami, to enjoy and spend your leisure time, to use imagination and intellect together, or innate alone.</p>
